<h89> <p> An interactive art piece that is meant to literally shed light on the role of women in tech industries.
Although still a work in progress, the user uses their hands as tools to move around the source of light and read the information on the shapes.
Each shape has a different fact or stastic about the bias against women in the tech industry. The piece is important to me as I drew inspiration from not only myself,
but also my classmates who were all women. The piece is one of my first art pieces using Open Frameworks. Since this piece is a work in progress, I am currently working
on making the shapes crash into eachother to depict the sense of conflict and eventually I would like to allow the user to control each individual shape.
with only women.   </p></h89>
